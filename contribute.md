We are using [bmlt-wordpress-deploy](https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/bmlt-wordpress-deploy/blob/master/README.md) to deploy the plugin to SVN.

To get things going in your local environment.

`docker-compose up`

Get your wordpress installation going.  Remember your admin password.  Once it's up, login to admin and activate the Upcoming Meetings BMLT" plugin.

Now you can make edits to the list-locations.php file and it will instantly take effect.

Please make note of the .editorconfig file and adhere to it as this will minimise the amount of formatting errors.  If you are using PHPStorm you will need to install the EditorConfig plugin.
